# Linux Pilot

Linux Pilot is an interactive system that translates natural language queries into Linux commands and executes them automatically. It simplifies Linux interactions by allowing users to perform tasks without needing to inner linux.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: Converts user queries like "open file.txt" or "show disk usage" into Linux commands.
- **Command Execution**: Executes the corresponding Linux commands in the background.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: No need for users to learn command syntax; just type a query and let the system handle the rest.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Linux-based operating system (since the system interacts with Linux commands)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
